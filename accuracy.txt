
 4. Ans: - we need to apply PCA algorithm in the image of 8 . because this picture is not co-related 	
	   picture , so that's why PCA algorithm should be apply. 

 4(1) ans: - Check the accuracy : - Accuracy score is calculated by dividing the number of correct              predictions by the total number of predictions. 
					
					 dividing the number of correct prediction			
		     Accuracy = 	___________________________________________
					  Total number of predictions 

	
 4(11) ans: - If accuracy is low then a lots of way imporve accuracy level such as : - 
		a. Add more data in the picture 8 . 
		b. Treat missing & outlier values. 
		c. Feature engineering : - In the feature engineering we can modify the data using 		   some feature transformation & feature creations in the picture 8 .
		d. Feature selection : - In feature selection we can use virtutalization & domain 
		   knowledge.
